### Lessons Learned

Our strategy of coding separately at the start of the project led to many issues, and missed opportunities to collaborate.

We struggled with implementing the delete option, we tried a variety of remedies to include, changing the web file, and searching for syntax errors. Ultimately, we were able to collaborate with other groups work out logic to correct or errors.

Overall we learned proper pair programming is key and once that was corrected, our sprint went much more smoothly.
